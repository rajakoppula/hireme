## Professional Summary

I'm a product-driven SEO and growth builder with 13 years of entrepreneurial experience. I don’t just rank websites; I architect growth systems that feed LLMs, create real visibility, and build a lasting presence in search. I’ve built and scaled affiliate brands, SaaS tools, and lead-gen systems from zero to six figures. I thrive in ambiguity, love building from scratch, and am looking for an equity-based role in a startup building for the future.
