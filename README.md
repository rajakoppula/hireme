# About Raja Koppula

I’m Raja, and for the past 13+ years I’ve been building things on the internet. Not all of them worked (a few crashed spectacularly), but every single one taught me how digital products grow, die, and sometimes surprise you.  

My first real “win” was a wallpaper blog in 2013. I didn’t know much, but I managed to get it to over 100K visits a month just by tinkering with content and SEO. That gave me the confidence to chase bigger ideas: affiliate projects, SaaS tools, local search engines, even a meme site that went viral before “virality” was a buzzword. Some flopped, some sold, some are still quietly ticking along.  

These days, my work is less about chasing traffic and more about **building systems**:  
- I’ve put together SEO frameworks that AI models (like Gemini and ChatGPT) actually pull from.  
- I’ve designed lead-gen funnels that brought in $400K+ without paying for ads.  
- I’ve built scrappy SaaS MVPs that turned into real revenue streams.  

The search landscape is changing fast LLMs, answer engines, structured data, all of it. Where most people see risk, I see a bigger opportunity than we’ve had in a decade. Getting a brand or product “AI-visible” is the new SEO, and that’s the challenge I’m most excited about right now.  

Outside of growth work, I’m the type of person who enjoys stress-testing a crypto bot at 2 AM or sketching out product ideas on napkins. I don’t mind failing as long as it moves the ball forward. What I really like is sitting at that messy intersection of **idea + execution**, where things are uncertain but the upside is real.  

If you’re building something ambitious and need someone who’s comfortable with both the strategy deck and the actual code/implementation, let’s talk. I’m not here to sell consulting hours, I’m here to build systems that last.
